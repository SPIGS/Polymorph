## About

*Polymorph* started off as an unnamed, little project originally based on the [Roguebasin Python tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python3%2Blibtcod). I soon abandoned it, and later revived it as a learning exercise for the Rust programming language. It has since eclipsed the original Python version and I am currently working on it in my free time. 

#### Current Features
- Level generation (caverns, foliage, lakes, lava pools, rudimentary structure generation)
- Dynamic lighting (per channel lighting, shadows)
- Tile animations
- Multiplatform
